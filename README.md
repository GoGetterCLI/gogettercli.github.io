This repo stores the source code for https://acei.us  
The latest builds can be found on http://staging.acei.us  
Feel free to use this to learn or as a template for your own website.  

## ðŸ’¾ Project Setup
First, clone the project to disk with the git.  
You will need:
 - Webserver (I use `python3 -m http.server`)
 - Vue and JS knowledge
 
Once you've made your changes, you can either use it for your own website (provided it's sufficently rebranded), or submit you changes to me via a merge request.
If your changes are deemed stable, they will be pushed to the [staging website](http://staging.acei.us).

## âš™ Development instructions
 - Keep your code clean
 - Use underscores not camel case or anything like that
 - Use ecma script (ex. let not var)
 - Use single quotes
 - When you delete a file, you must name your commit 'Delteeted filename'
   - This is a rule not a joke
