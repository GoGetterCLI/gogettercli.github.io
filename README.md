## ðŸ’¾ Project Setup
First, clone the project to disk with the git.  
You will need:
 - Webserver (I use `python3 -m http.server`)
 - Vue and JS knowledge
 
Once you've made your changes, you can either use it for your own website (provided it's sufficently rebranded), or submit you changes to me via a merge request.
If your changes are deemed stable, they will be pushed to the [staging website](http://staging.acei.us).
