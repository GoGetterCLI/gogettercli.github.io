Welcome to Acei.us! :sunglasses:

While you are on this site, I collect certain data on your device using:
 - Server logs
 - Google Analytics

These services are delivered via insane blak majik wizardree that google and my hosting provider do

Some data I collect on your device:
 - Data you give me (I.E. your email if you sign up for Nextcloud)
 - IP
 - Location
 - Engagement
 - Time spent on page
 - What pages you visit

It should also be noted that Acei.us (and our Nextcloud instance) are hosted on Aceius's ~~personal potato~~ server and I can access your data (not that i do) if its not encrypted.
